# Sumo Robot for NI Robotics League

it's a robot + some extras

## Directories

**Sumo_Robot** - one version (of many) of the robot that pushes cans of beans around<br>
**Sumo_Robot_Random** - unfinished random robot code derived from [this sketch](https://github.com/player2point0/MineSweeper)<br>
**bean_robot** - a much better robot sketch based on Sumo_Robot<br>
**ultrasonic_grapher** - averages ultrasonic sensor readings, and prints it to Serial (you can use the serial plotter)

## Dependencies
just Ultrasonic.h, although bean_robot depends on Paul Stroffregen's [Encoder library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder)
